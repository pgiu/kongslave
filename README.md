DNP3 RTU simulator based on the opendnp3 library. 
Generates N channels with M RTUs on each channel.
Similar to the official demo but on stereoids.
Originally built to test the opendnp3-based autotrol DNP3 data concentrator.

## Build 

Tested with opendnp3 version 2.0.1 and Visual Studio 2013.
No Linux version, but should be easy to write a Makefile. 

## Run

Use the release version `release/`
Call it without parameters to see the sintax or use the .bat files to learn how
to use it.
